# Startup Scripts for CSPs with Spark Rapids

With the exception of Dataproc, CSP offerings like EMR have specific set of steps that are required to enable the Spark Rapids Plugin in their environment. The set of scripts here automate parts of that process, for EMR currently. The exact usage can be found in our docs [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/spark-rapids/user-guide/latest/getting-started/aws-emr.html)

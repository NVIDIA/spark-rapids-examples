# Open Street Map Benchmarks
[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright/en) is a collaborative, free, 
and open-source digital map of the world. It allows users to contribute to the creation and editing
of maps through a simple, web-based interface. Anyone can contribute to the project by mapping areas
they are familiar with, either through manual surveys, satellite imagery, or aerial photographs.

Users can perform analyses by running Spark ETL jobs based on datasets that include geospatial analysis,
traffic flow, socioeconomic analysis, environmental analysis, route optimization, etc. The queries on it 
can stray into terabytes, [Spark Rapids](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/) can speed up the
entire analysis process.

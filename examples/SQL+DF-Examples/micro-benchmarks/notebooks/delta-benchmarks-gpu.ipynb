    "This is a microbenchmark about windowing expressions running on GPU mode. The sub-query calculates the average ss_sales_price of a fixed window function partition by ss_customer_sk, and the parent query calculates the average price of the sub-query grouping by each customer. You will see about 25x speedups in this query. The speedup mainly comes from GPUSort/GPUWindow/GPUHashAggregate. The avg aggregation function evaluates all rows which are generated by the sub-query's window function. There will be a more significant performance improvement along with the increasing number of sub-query aggregate functions."

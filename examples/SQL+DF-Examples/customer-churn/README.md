# Customer Churn

This demo is derived from [data-science-blueprints](https://github.com/NVIDIA/data-science-blueprints) repository.
The repository shows a realistic ETL workflow based on synthetic normalized data.  It consists of two pieces:

1.  _an augmentation notebook_, which synthesizes normalized (long-form) data from a wide-form input file,
    optionally augmenting it by duplicating records, and
2. _an ETL notebook_, which performs joins and aggregations in order to generate wide-form data from the synthetic long-form data.

To learn more about the customer churn use case, you can read our [ebook](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/resources/churn-prediction-blueprint/).

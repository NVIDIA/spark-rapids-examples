# Spark-cuSpatial

This is a Spark RapidsUDF application to illustrate how to use [cuSpatial](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuspatial) to solve a point-in-polygon problem.
It implements a [RapidsUDF](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/docs/additional-functionality/rapids-udfs.html#adding-gpu-implementations-to-udfs) 
interface to call the cuSpatial functions through JNI. It can be run on a distributed Spark cluster with scalability.

## Performance
We got the end-2-end time as below table when running with 2009 NYC Taxi trip pickup location,
which includes 168,898,952 points, and 3 sets of polygons(taxi_zone, nyct2000, nycd).
The data can be downloaded from [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) 
and [NYC Open data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page#district_political).
| Environment | Taxi_zones (263 Polygons) | Nyct2000 (2216 Polygons) | Nycd (71 Complex Polygons)|
| ----------- | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| 4-core CPU | 1122.9 seconds | 5525.4 seconds| 6642.7 seconds |
| 1 GPU(Titan V) on local | 4.5 seconds | 5.7 seconds | 6.6 seconds|
| 2 GPU(T4) on Databricks | 9.1 seconds | 10.0 seconds | 12.1 seconds |

## Build
You can build the jar file [in Docker](#build-in-docker) with the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
or you can build it [in local](#build-in-local) machine after some prerequisites.

### Build in Docker
1. Build the docker image [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), then run the container.
     ```Bash
     docker build -f Dockerfile . -t build-spark-cuspatial
     docker run -it build-spark-cuspatial bash
     ```
2. Get the code, then run "mvn package".
     ```Bash
     git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-examples.git
     cd spark-rapids-examples/examples/UDF-Examples/Spark-cuSpatial/
     mvn package
     ```
3. You'll get the jar named like "spark-cuspatial-<version>.jar" in the target folder.

### Build in Local:
1. essential build tools:
    - [cmake(>=3.20)](https://cmake.org/download/),
    - [ninja(>=1.10)](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases),
    - [gcc(>=9.3)](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html)
2. [CUDA Toolkit(>=11.0)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
3. conda: use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to maintain header files and cmake dependecies
4. [cuspatial](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuspatial): install libcuspatial
    ```Bash
    # get libcuspatial from conda
    conda install -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c conda-forge  -c defaults libcuspatial=22.04
    # or below command for the nightly (aka SNAPSHOT) version.
    conda install -c rapidsai-nightly -c nvidia -c conda-forge  -c defaults libcuspatial=22.06
    ```
5. Get the code, then run "mvn package".
     ```Bash
     git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-examples.git
     cd spark-rapids-examples/examples/Spark-cuSpatial/
     mvn package
     ```
6. You'll get "spark-cuspatial-<version>.jar" in the target folder.      


## Run
### Run on-premises clusters: standalone
1. Install necessary libraries. Besides `cudf` and `cuspatial`, the `gdal` library that is compatible with the installed `cuspatial` may also be needed.
    Install it by running the command below.
    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge libgdal=3.3.1
    ```
2. Set up [a standalone cluster](/docs/get-started/xgboost-examples/on-prem-cluster/standalone-scala.md) of Spark. Make sure the conda/lib is included in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that spark executors can load libcuspatial.so.

3. Download spark-rapids jars
   * [spark-rapids v22.06.0](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/nvidia/rapids-4-spark_2.12/22.06.0/rapids-4-spark_2.12-22.06.0.jar) or above
4. Prepare the dataset & jars. Copy the sample dataset from [cuspatial_data](../../../datasets/cuspatial_data.tar.gz) to "/data/cuspatial_data".
    Copy spark-rapids & spark-cuspatial-22.06.0-SNAPSHOT.jar to "/data/cuspatial_data/jars".
    You can use your own path, but remember to update the paths in "gpu-run.sh" accordingly.
5. Run "gpu-run.sh"
    ```Bash
    ./gpu-run.sh
    ```
### Run on AWS Databricks
1. Build the customized docker image [Dockerfile.awsdb](Dockerfile.awsdb) and push to dockerhub so that it can be accessible by AWS Databricks.
     ```Bash
     # replace your dockerhub repo, your tag or any other repo AWS DB can access
     docker build -f Dockerfile.awsdb . -t <your-dockerhub-repo>:<your-tag>
     docker push <your-dockerhub-repo>:<your-tag>
     ```
 
2. Follow the [Spark-rapids get-started document](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/docs/get-started/getting-started-databricks.html#start-a-databricks-cluster) to create a GPU cluster on AWS Databricks.
 Something different from the document.
    * Databricks Runtime Version
  You should choose a Standard version of the Runtime version like "Runtime: 9.1 LTS(Scala 2.12, Spark 3.1.2)" and
  choose GPU instance type like "g4dn.xlarge". Note that ML runtime does not support customized docker container.
  If you choose a ML version, it says "Support for Databricks container services requires runtime version 5.3+" 
  and the "Confirm" button is disabled.
    * Use your own Docker container
  Input "Docker Image URL" as "your-dockerhub-repo:your-tag"
    * For the other configurations, you can follow the get-started document.

3. Copy the sample [cuspatial_data.tar.gz](../../../datasets/cuspatial_data.tar.gz) or your data to DBFS by using Databricks CLI.
    ```Bash
    # extract the data
    tar zxf cuspatial_data.tar.gz
    databricks fs cp -r cuspatial_data/* dbfs:/data/cuspatial_data/
    databricks fs ls dbfs:/data/cuspatial_data/
    # it should have below 2 folders.
        points
        polygons
    ```
4. Import the Library "spark-cuspatial-22.06.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" to the Databricks, then install it to your cluster.
5. Import [cuspatial_sample.ipynb](notebooks/cuspatial_sample_db.ipynb) to your workspace in Databricks. Attach to your cluster, then run it.

# NVIDIA Support for GPU for YARN with MIG support for YARN 3.1.2 until YARN 3.3.0

This adds support for GPUs with [MIG](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/) on YARN for versions prior to
YARN 3.3.0 which don't support the pluggable device framework. Use the [GPU Plugin for YARN with MIG support](../../device-plugins/gpu-mig/README.md)
for YARN 3.3.0 and newer versions. The built-in YARN GPU plugin does not support MIG enabled GPUs. This patch
works with GPUs without MIG or GPUs with MIG disabled but the limitation section still applies. It supports heterogenous
environments where there may be some MIG enabled GPUs and some without MIG. This requires patching YARN and rebuilding it.

## Compatibility

Requires YARN 3.1.2 or newer that supports GPU scheduling. See the [supported versions](#supported-versions) section below for specific versions supported.
MIG support requires YARN to be configured with Docker and using the NVIDIA Container Toolkit (nvidia-docker2)

## Limitations

Please see the [MIG Application Considerations](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/#app-considerations)
and [CUDA Device Enumeration](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#cuda-visible-devices).

It is important to note that CUDA 11 only supports enumeration of a single MIG instance. This means that with this patch 
and MIG support enabled, it only supports 1 GPU per container and will throw an exception by default if you request more.
It is recommended that you configure YARN to only allow a single GPU be requested. See the yarn config:
```
 yarn.resource-types.yarn.io/gpu.maximum-allocation
```
See [YARN Resource Configuration](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.1.2/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ResourceModel.html) for more details.
If you do not configure the maximum allocation and someone requests multiple GPUs, the default behavior is to throw an exception.
See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for options if it throws an exception.

## Supported Versions
There are different patches available depending on the YARN version you are using:

- YARN 3.1.2 use patch `yarn312MIG.patch`
- YARN versions 3.1.3 to 3.1.5 (git hash cd7c34f9b4005d27886f73e58bef88e706fcccf9 since 3.1.5 was not released when this was tested) use `yarn313to315MIG.patch`
- YARN 3.2.0, no patch is currently available, backport patch for YARN 3.2.1 or contact us.
- YARN 3.2.1 and 3.2.3 use patch `yarn321to323MIG.patch`

## Building
Apply the patch to your YARN version and build it like you would normally for your deployment.

For example:
```
patch -p1 < yarn312MIG.patch
mvn clean package -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests
```

Run unit tests:
```
mvn test -Pdist -Dtar -Dtest=TestGpuDiscoverer
mvn test -Pdist -Dtar -Dtest=TestNvidiaDockerV2CommandPlugin
```

## Installation

These instructions assume YARN is already installed and configured with GPU Scheduling enabled using Docker and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit (nvidia-docker2).
See [Using GPU on YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/UsingGpus.html) if you need more information. 

Enable and configure your [GPUs with MIG](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html) on all of the nodes it applies to.

Install the new YARN version built with the patch on your YARN Cluster.

Enable the MIG GPU support in the Hadoop configuration files:

```
<property>
  <name>yarn.nodemanager.resource-plugins.gpu.use-mig-enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>

```

Restart YARN if needed to pick up any configuration changes.

## Configuration

The default behavior of the GPU resource plugin on YARN is to use `auto` discovery mode of GPUs on each nodemanager.
It also allows you to manually allow certain gpu devices. This configuration was extended to support MIG devices.
`yarn.nodemanager.resource-plugins.gpu.allowed-gpu-devices` configuration can be used to manually specify devices.
GPU device is identified by their minor device number, index, and optionally MIG device index. A common approach to get
minor device number of GPUs is using nvidia-smi -q and search Minor Number output and optionally MIG device indices.
The format is index:minor_number[:mig_index][,index:minor_number...]. An example of manual specification is
0:0,1:1:0,1:1:1,2:2" to allow YARN NodeManager to manage GPU devices with indices 0/1/2 and minor number 0/1/2
where GPU indices 1 has 2 MIG enabled devices with indices 0/1.
```
<property>
  <name>yarn.nodemanager.resource-plugins.gpu.allowed-gpu-devices</name>
  <value>0:0,1:1:0,1:1:1,2:2</value>
</property>
```

To change the behavior of throwing when the user allocates multiple GPUs can be controlled by setting an environment variable
when the Spark application is launched. Setting it to `true` means to throw if a user requests multiple GPUs (this is the default), `false`
means it won't throw and if the container is allocated with multiple MIG devices from the same GPU, it is up to the
application to know how to use them.

Environment variable for Spark application:
```
--conf spark.executorEnv.NVIDIA_MIG_PLUGIN_THROW_ON_MULTIPLE_GPUS=false
```

## Testing
Run a Spark application using the [Rapids Accelerator for Apache Spark](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/) and request GPUs
from YARN and verify they use the MIG enabled GPUs.

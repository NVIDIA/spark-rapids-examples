    "\n",
    "A few libraries required for this notebook:\n",
    "  1. cudf-cu11\n",
    "  2. xgboost\n",

    "This notebook also illustrates the ease of porting a sample CPU based Spark xgboost4j code into GPU. There is no change required for running Spark XGBoost on GPU because both CPU and GPU call the same API. For CPU run, we need to vectorize the trained dataset before fitting data to classifier."

Get Started with XGBoost4J-Spark on an Apache Spark Standalone Cluster
======================================================================

This is a getting-started guide to XGBoost on an Apache Spark 3.1+ Standalone Cluster. At the end of this guide,
the user can run a sample Apache Spark application that runs on NVIDIA GPUs.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Apache Spark 3.1.1+ Standalone Cluster (e.g.: Spark 3.1.1)
* Hardware Requirements
  * NVIDIA Pascalâ„¢ GPU architecture or better
  * Multi-node clusters with homogenous GPU configuration
* Software Requirements
  * Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04/CentOS7, CentOS8
  * CUDA 11.0+
  * NVIDIA driver compatible with your CUDA
  * NCCL 2.7.8+
  
The number of GPUs in each host dictates the number of Spark executors that can run there. Additionally,
cores per Spark executor and cores per Spark task must match, such that each executor can run 1 task at any given time.

For example, if each host has 4 GPUs, there should be 4 or fewer executors running on each host,
and each executor should run at most 1 task (e.g.: a total of 4 tasks running on 4 GPUs).

In Spark Standalone mode, the default configuration is for an executor to take up all the cores assigned to each Spark Worker.
In this example, we will limit the number of cores to 1, to match our dataset.
Please see https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html for more documentation regarding Standalone configuration.

We use `SPARK_HOME` environment variable to point to the Apache Spark cluster.
And here are steps to enable the GPU resources discovery for Spark 3.1+.

1. Copy the spark configure file from template.

    ``` bash
    cd ${SPARK_HOME}/conf/
    cp spark-defaults.conf.template spark-defaults.conf
    ```

2. Add the following configs to the file `spark-defaults.conf`.
  
    The number in first config should NOT be larger than the actual number of the GPUs on current host.
   This example uses 1 as below for one GPU on the host.

    ``` bash
    spark.worker.resource.gpu.amount 1
    spark.worker.resource.gpu.discoveryScript ${SPARK_HOME}/examples/src/main/scripts/getGpusResources.sh
    ```

Get Jars and Dataset
-------------------------------

Make sure you have prepared the necessary packages and dataset 
by following this [guide](/docs/get-started/xgboost-examples/prepare-package-data/preparation-scala.md)

Note: the `mortgage_eval_merged.csv` and `mortgage_train_merged.csv` are not Mortgage raw data,
they are the data produced by Mortgage ETL job. If user wants to use a larger size Mortgage data, please refer to [Launch ETL job](#etl).
Taxi ETL job is the same. But Agaricus does not have ETL process, it is combined with XGBoost as there is just a filter operation.

Launch a Standalone Spark Cluster
---------------------------------

1. Copy required jars to `$SPARK_HOME/jars` folder.

    ``` bash
    cp $RAPIDS_JAR $SPARK_HOME/jars/
    ```

2. Start the Spark Master process.

    ``` bash
    ${SPARK_HOME}/sbin/start-master.sh
    ```

    Note the hostname or ip address of the Master host, so that it can be given to each Worker process,
    in this example the Master and Worker will run on the same host.

3. Start a Spark slave process.

    ``` bash
    export SPARK_MASTER=spark://`hostname -f`:7077
    export SPARK_CORES_PER_WORKER=1

    ${SPARK_HOME}/sbin/start-slave.sh ${SPARK_MASTER} -c ${SPARK_CORES_PER_WORKER} 
    ```

    Note that in this example the Master and Worker processes are both running on the same host. 
    This is not a requirement, as long as all hosts that are used to run the Spark app have access to the dataset.

<span id="etl">Launch Mortgage or Taxi ETL Part</span>
---------------------------

If user wants to use a larger size dataset other than the default one, we provide an ETL app to process raw Mortgage data.

Run spark-submit

``` bash

    --master spark://$HOSTNAME:7077 \
    --executor-memory 32G \

```

In `stdout` log on driver side, you should see timings<sup>*</sup> (in seconds), 
and the accuracy metric(take Mortgage as example):

```
--------------
==> Benchmark: Elapsed time for [Mortgage GPU train csv stub Unknown Unknown Unknown]: 26.572s
--------------

--------------
==> Benchmark: Elapsed time for [Mortgage GPU transform csv stub Unknown Unknown Unknown]: 10.323s
--------------

--------------
==> Benchmark: Accuracy for [Mortgage GPU Accuracy csv stub Unknown Unknown Unknown]: 0.9869227318579323
--------------
```

Launch XGBoost Part on CPU
---------------------------

If you are running this example after running the GPU example above, please set these variables, 
to set both training and testing to run on the CPU exclusively:

``` bash
# this is the same master host we defined while launching the cluster
export SPARK_MASTER=spark://`hostname -f`:7077

# Currently the number of tasks and executors must match the number of input files.
# For this example, we will set these such that we have 1 executor, with 1 core per executor

## take up the the whole worker
export SPARK_CORES_PER_EXECUTOR=${SPARK_CORES_PER_WORKER}

## run 1 executor
export SPARK_NUM_EXECUTORS=1

## cores/executor * num_executors, which in this case is also 1, limits
## the number of cores given to the application
export TOTAL_CORES=$((SPARK_CORES_PER_EXECUTOR * SPARK_NUM_EXECUTORS))

# spark driver memory
export SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY=4g

# spark executor memory
export SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY=8g

# example class to use
export EXAMPLE_CLASS=com.nvidia.spark.examples.mortgage.CPUMain
# Please make sure to change the class while running Taxi or Agaricus benchmark     

# tree construction algorithm
export TREE_METHOD=hist
```

This is the same command as for the GPU example, repeated for convenience:

``` bash
${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit                                                  \
 --master ${SPARK_MASTER}                                                       \
 --driver-memory ${SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY}                                         \
 --executor-memory ${SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY}                                     \
 --conf spark.cores.max=${TOTAL_CORES}                                          \
 --class ${EXAMPLE_CLASS}                                                       \
 ${SAMPLE_JAR}                                                                 \
 -dataPath=train::${SPARK_XGBOOST_DIR}/mortgage/csv/train/mortgage_train_merged.csv       \
 -dataPath=trans::${SPARK_XGBOOST_DIR}/mortgage/csv/test/mortgage_eval_merged.csv          \
 -format=csv                                                                    \
 -numWorkers=${SPARK_NUM_EXECUTORS}                                             \
 -treeMethod=${TREE_METHOD}                                                     \
 -numRound=100                                                                  \
 -maxDepth=8                  
 
 # Please make sure to change the class and data path while running Taxi or Agaricus benchmark                                                       
```
